          <p>
            Welcome, to the june Hackathon extravaganza at Fronter! To make sure this Hackathon
            will become slightly more awesome than previous years, we have made some changes
            to the Hackathon formula.

              <li>We are not going arrange the Hackathon at Fronter, this years event will be held at an remote location.</li> 
              <li>The competition rules will not be as strict as previous years, the object is to have fun!</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <h3>2. Where, when and how.</h3>
          <p>
            This years event will be held from the 6.-7., June, at <a href="http://www.rosenholmcampus.no/">Rosenholm Campus</a>, at Kolbotn (10-20 mins with taxi, bus or train from Oslo Central Station).<br><br>
            Anyone who wants to join, can do so, does not matter if you are from hosting, product, development, marketing og release. As long as you want to participate in the competition you are qualified! <br> For those of you that want to sleep during the night, we offer an overnight stay at Quality Hotel Mastemyr. Please let us know if you want a hotel room. It is free of charge, but you need to find a room mate to bunk with.<br><br>
            We will be setting up two maxi taxis from Fronter, leaving at 09:10 AM og June 6th. We will meet at 9 AM to do a people-count and hand out details.
          </p>
          <h3>3. The competition</h3>
          <p>
            This years competition does not enforce any strict rules. We want you to gather in groups of 3-4 people,
            and make something awesome. It can be anything, but it must be presentable by 16:00 on Friday, June, 7th.
            We will of course be expecting you to be curious about new technology, methods and frameworks.
            <br><br>
            We will not be handing out the trophy this year. The trophy is hereby extinct.
            A proper prize will be announced, but the prize is not really important. The important this is to
            build something together, and have fun.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Food and drinks</h3>
          <p>When we get there, a buffee will be waiting for us, and a lunch will be served later on.
          In the evening we will order pizzas, and soft drinks will be available. It will also be possible
          to enjoy a beer if you enjoy thise kind of things :)</p>
